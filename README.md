I'm passionate about everything Data and Machine Learning. My areas of interest are:

- ❤️ **Sentiment Analysis:** How people feel about certain events, products or topics
- 🕐 **Time Series Analysis:** Changes over time

In my free time, I create videos on Tiktok about Python and how to use it for Data Science and Machine Learning.
