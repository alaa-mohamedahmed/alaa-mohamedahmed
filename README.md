## Hello 👋🏾

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning corner. <br>
Here's a glimpse of what I bring to the table:

- **📈 Driving Social Impact:** A big believer of the power of data to drive positive change and shed light on important topics that impact society.
-  **🌐 Social Network Analysis:** Using Machine Learning to unveil biases and detect racism in digital spaces; and to understand how extremist content is dissiminated.
- **❤️ Sentiment Analysis:** I'm intrigued by the nuanced tapestry of human emotions and opinions. Exploring sentiment helps me understand how people perceive events, products, and things like immigration, crime, elections, etc.,
- **🕐 Time Series Analysis:** Love capturing the ebbs and flows of data over time and unravelling trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- **📊 Creating Beautiful Visualizations**

Beyond coding, I'm an advocate of knowledge sharing. In my free time, I create videos on [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@datawithalaa) about Data Science and Mashine learning with Python.

Join my journey!
